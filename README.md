# ACM's first enrichment workshop!
## How to debug programs using GDB!

GDB is a portable debugger for multiple languages (Ada, C, C++, Objective-C,
Free Pascal, Fortran, Go, Java and partially others)

Works on Unix-like and Windows OS's

Useful for stepping through code one line at a time and finding bugs

## Useful Commands:

list - display source code from within the debugger

step - execute the current line of your program

next - execute the current line of your program. Steps over function calls.

cont - continue from current position to the next breakpoint

break - set breakpoint at a specific location in your program

print - display the value of a variable

backtrace - display the trace of the calls for your functions (which functions
called which other functions)

quit - stop the debugger

start - start/restart your programâ€™s execution
